# OSINT Expert Roadmap & Methodology

A complete, realistic and ethical framework to learn, practice and professionalize Open Source Intelligence (OSINT), from beginner to expert level.

## About this project

This repository provides a structured and progressive OSINT framework.  
It goes beyond simple information gathering and focuses on analytical rigor, verification and validation, ethical and legal boundaries, and professional reporting.

The goal is to help learners transition from OSINT hobbyist to credible OSINT analyst.

## Intended audience

This repository is designed for:
- OSINT learners (beginner to advanced)
- Journalists and researchers
- Cybersecurity and threat intelligence professionals
- Anyone interested in responsible open-source investigations

This repository is not intended for:
- Doxxing or harassment
- Illegal data collection
- Privacy violations
- Unethical OSINT practices

## Core principles

This project is built on the following principles:
- Legality before capability
- Ethics before curiosity
- Verification before conclusion
- Methodology before tools
- Documentation before intuition
- Acceptance of uncertainty

OSINT is not about finding information.  
It is about producing reliable and defensible intelligence.

## Roadmap overview

The learning path is divided into six progressive phases.

### Phase 1: Foundations OSINT
Legal framework, critical thinking, OPSEC, search fundamentals

### Phase 2: SOCMINT and Digital Identities
Social media analysis, alias correlation, timelines, metadata

### Phase 3: GEOINT and Verification
Image and video verification, geolocation, disinformation analysis

### Phase 4: Automation and Technical OSINT
Web fundamentals, scraping, APIs, infrastructure mapping

### Phase 5: Strategic Analysis and Professional OSINT
Analytical frameworks, reporting, decision-maker briefings

### Phase 6: Specialization
Cyber, journalism, conflicts, corporate, or financial OSINT

## Repository structure

- roadmap/ — learning roadmaps (standard and expert)
- methodology/ — investigation and analytical methodologies
- templates/ — investigation and reporting templates
- checklists/ — operational checklists

## How to use this repository

Start with the roadmap that matches your level.  
Follow the methodology during investigations.  
Use templates and checklists systematically.  
Separate facts, hypotheses and judgments.  
Document all sources and reasoning.  
Validate your conclusions externally.

## Skill validation

OSINT expertise requires external validation.

Recommended activities:
- OSINT challenges and CTFs
- Reproducing public investigations
- Peer review and collaboration
- Publishing documented work

Without validation, OSINT skills remain theoretical.
